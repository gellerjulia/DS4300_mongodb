1. Businesses per State
While a bit hard to tell, in the barchart Arizona has about 30,000 buinsesses represented in the dataset while 
California has 2 and South Carolina has 1. This is surprising as we would have thought the dataset represents businesses 
across the entire US that are in Yelp's database. It is important to know which states have their businesses represented in 
this dataset to know for which people this data could be most useful for. Further, this graph is well suited for instances when 
the full yelp dataset can be obtained to understand the geographic distribution of records in the dataset.

2. Number of Businesses for each Type
The graph shows that the most common types of businsses in the dataset are resturants, shopping, and health and medical.
 While resutrants ebing commmon is unsurprising, it is more surprising that health and medical businesses have a high representaiton on yelp.
 Further, it is interesting that food, sandwiches, and restaurants are three distinct categories and show how detailed this attribute of
 the data is and thus how well suited it is for specific queries. 

 3. Number of Businsses per City
 The cities iwth the most businsses are Phoenix, Scotssdale, and Tempe. While Phoenix is less unsurprising, the other 
 two are as I had not previously known they were large cities. North Scottsdale has the least amount of buinesses, which is
 surprising given that Scottsdale had the second highest number of businesses.
